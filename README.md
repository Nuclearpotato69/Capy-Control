### Multiple Instance Setup
1. Download and install Roblox Account Manager (RAM)
2. Add your accounts to RAM:
   - Click "Add Account"
   - Enter your account credentials
   - Repeat for all accounts you want to control
3. To launch multiple instances:
   - Select the accounts you want to use
   - Click "Join Game"
   - Enter the game's Place ID
   - RAM will automatically launch separate Roblox instances for each account

### Script Setup Instructions
1. Purchase and install either SirHurt or Xeno executor (Sirhurt is paid, Xeno is free)
2. Configure the script with your accounts:

```lua
-- Alt Control Script Configuration
_G.prefix = "/" -- Command prefix
_G.mainAccount = "MAIN ACCOUNT HERE" -- Main account to control alt accounts
_G.fpslimit = 30 -- Default FPS limit for alt accounts

-- List of alt accounts to control
_G.altAccounts = {
    ["ACCOUNT 1"] = true,
    ["ACCOUNT 2"] = true,
    ["ACCOUNT 3"] = true --copy this line and paste it below to add more accounts (make sure there's a comma after each line)
}

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nuclearpotato69/Punchy-Alt-Control/main/main.lua", true))()
